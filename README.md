## About
Disclaimer: This project is still very much a work in progress.

[MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/) is a project that collects all the information around Magic: the Gathering cards and products. This library provides a series of tools to interface with those collections as well as other major services in the MtG ecosystem. There are also tools for working with other major concepts that are common in MtG, such as decks and card collections.
